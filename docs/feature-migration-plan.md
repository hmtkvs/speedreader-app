# Feature Migration Plan

## Current Status

The application is in the process of migrating from a technical-oriented structure (organized by components, utils, etc.) to a feature-based structure. Some features have already been migrated, but many components and utilities still need to be properly organized into features.

## Identified Features

Based on the analysis of the existing components and utilities, the following features have been identified:

| Feature | Status | Components | Utilities |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Reader | Partially Migrated | FullscreenReader.tsx | tts.ts |
| PDF Management | Partially Migrated | PDFUploader.tsx, PDFList.tsx, PDFManager.tsx, SavedPDFsPanel.tsx | pdfValidator.ts, pdfStorage.ts, pdfParser.ts |
| Authentication | Partially Migrated | - | auth.ts |
| Subscription | Partially Migrated | SubscriptionModal.tsx | subscription.ts, stripe.ts |
| Statistics | Partially Migrated | StatsPanel.tsx | statistics.ts, analytics.ts |
| Settings | Not Migrated | SettingsModal.tsx, TTSSettings.tsx | - |
| Translation | Not Migrated | TranslationTooltip.tsx | translation.ts, translationMocks.ts |
| UI/Common | Not Migrated | SlideIndicator.tsx, UploadNotification.tsx | - |
| Landing | Not Migrated | LandingPage.tsx, FileUploadCorner.tsx | - |
| Storage | Not Migrated | - | database.ts, storage.ts |
| Platform | Not Migrated | - | platform.ts |
| Security | Not Migrated | - | security.ts, rateLimiter.ts |
| Error Handling | Not Migrated | - | errorHandler.ts |
| Monitoring | Not Migrated | - | monitoring.ts |

## Feature Structure

Each feature should follow this standard structure:

```
src/
  features/
    feature-name/
      components/      # UI components specific to this feature
      hooks/           # Custom hooks for this feature
      services/        # Services and business logic
      utils/           # Helper functions specific to this feature
      models/          # Data models and types
      api/             # API calls related to this feature
      contexts/        # React contexts if needed
      constants.ts     # Feature-specific constants
      index.ts         # Public API exports
```

## Implementation Approach

1. For each feature, create the full directory structure if it doesn't exist
2. Migrate components with minimal changes first to ensure functionality is preserved
3. Refactor utilities into proper services with consistent naming
4. Update imports in App.tsx and other files
5. Create index.ts files to expose public API for each feature
6. Test thoroughly after each feature is migrated
7. Once all features are migrated, remove empty src/components and src/utils directories

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Complete already started features (Reader, PDF Management, Authentication, Subscription, Statistics) - 1 week
- **Phase 2**: Create new features (Settings, Translation, UI/Common, Landing) - 1 week
- **Phase 3**: Create Core feature and finalize migration - 1 week
- **Phase 4**: Testing and cleanup - 1 week

## Potential Challenges and Considerations

1. Some components might be tightly coupled and need significant refactoring
2. App.tsx is large (757 lines) and needs to be refactored to use the new feature structure
3. Need to ensure proper dependency management between features
4. Consider creating shared models for cross-feature types
5. Implement proper error boundaries for each feature
6. Ensure consistent documentation across all features

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

During the migration of features from the monolithic architecture to the feature-based approach, we encountered several significant challenges. These issues and their solutions can serve as valuable lessons for future migrations:

### Context Communication Challenges

1. **Nested Context Providers**: Multiple nested context providers (Theme, Reader, etc.) created isolation issues where state changes in one context weren't reflected in components using another context. 

   **Solution**: For critical data flows, implement direct prop passing rather than relying on context propagation through multiple layers.

2. **Component Hierarchy Complexity**: The deep component hierarchies made it difficult to trace data flow and debug issues.

   **Solution**: Flatten hierarchies where possible and add explicit data flow tracking, particularly for critical paths like text setting.

### PDF Management Specific Issues

1. **PDF Content Flow**: The most critical issue was the flow of text content from PDFs to the reader component. We found that this flow was breaking due to context boundaries.

   **Solution**: Implement direct communication for text setting using callbacks passed as props:
   ```typescript
   <FileUploadCorner
     directSetText={(text) => reader.setText(text)}
   />
   ```

2. **Panel Opening/Closing Timing**: The timing of panel opening/closing relative to text setting operations caused state inconsistencies.

   **Solution**: Use controlled timeouts to ensure state updates are complete before UI transitions:
   ```typescript
   // First set the text
   setText(content);
   // Wait for state to update before closing panel
   setTimeout(() => onClose(), 300);
   ```

3. **Multiple Text Setting Paths**: Different components (upload button, saved PDFs panel) needed to set text, making it hard to track the source of issues.

   **Solution**: Add comprehensive logging to every text-setting code path and standardize the approach across components.

### Verification Approaches

To verify migrations are successful:

1. **Direct Model Testing**: Test critical operations by manipulating models directly rather than just through UI interactions.

2. **Cross-Component Flow Testing**: Create tests that specifically verify data flow between components.

3. **Visual Indicators**: Add UI indicators for state changes to make issues more visible during testing.

4. **Staged Migrations**: Use adapters as a bridge between old and new architectures, allowing components to be migrated one at a time.

### Future Migration Recommendations

1. **Test Core Flows First**: Before migrating individual components, identify and test the most critical data flows.

2. **Add Debug Tooling Early**: Add comprehensive logging or debug tools before starting migrations.

3. **Use Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations for easier testing.

4. **Document Component Dependencies**: Create dependency maps for components before starting migrations to identify potential issues.

## Original Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the current technical-oriented structure to a feature-based structure.

The goal is to organize the codebase around features rather than technical categories.
